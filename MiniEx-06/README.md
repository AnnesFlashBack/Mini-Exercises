## Thoughts of a Rainy Day
When the subject of generativity came up for this exercise, the first thing I thought of was rain. I am not sure why exactly that was, but the idea of it was lodged in my head and would not go away. Perhaps it was the bad weather we have been having or my own mood taking a nosedive, I am not entirely certain. All I know is that the thought of “rain” has been stuck in my mind for days now, and played a big part in how this process of this project was finalized. 

When the weather takes a turn for the worst, moody thoughts often accompany it. Rain brings on thoughts of sorrow and sadness, as is seen in every cheesy crying scene of any big Hollywood movie ever. At first, I wanted to chase this feeling. I wanted to make an animation of a figure walking, head drooping, while rain drops cascaded down on him from above, but the more I considered it, the more I disliked the idea. I didn’t want to make dreary and dim piece, but instead focus on good things. Happy things. Who knows, this might have been some strangely therapeutic way of handling my own bad mood. And honestly… it kinda worked, weirdly enough. 

This brings me to my three rules:
-	There has to be colour. 
-	There should be some sort of “downpour” effect.
-	There should be background music. 

Incorporating colour was extremely important, I felt. Instead of focusing on the dull grey of sloshy snow or wet asphalt, I wanted to bring colour and vibrancy into the program. It would bring some life and joy into what could, otherwise, be considered a rather dull piece. 

It was the same with the music. I know this was not a terribly difficult rule to follow, but it was still a requirement I felt. I almost always listen to music when it’s raining. 

Then came the downpour. It was a bit of a trial and error process to get it to work the way I wanted to. Creating the trail behind the circles was pretty difficult to get working, and I eventually had to get some help from a friend. What I ended up with was a program, which, every 0.3 seconds, makes a circle beneath the canvas which has a random size, colour, and speed. These circles will then rise up, making trails behind them, much like raindrops on a windshield. 

At first, the circles were placed to be falling instead of rising, but I felt that conveyed a negative feeling which didn’t correspond well with the more joyous feeling I wanted to convey. I wanted this to be a program you could become lost in while you watched.

In the end, “bubble” is probably a more apt description of the circles than “raindrop.” A little bubble of colour rising through either darkness or light. That thought was what brought interactivity into the code. I really like it when the user is able to actually use the program in some way, so I made a small interaction between the program and the mouse. Whenever you click the mouse, the background changes colour and changes how the rising circles are seen. Their colours become either faded or vibrant, depending on which colour they are contrasting. 

I would also like to clarify that I did not have much time to work on this project this week due to some other obligations, so that program is fairly simple. If I’d had more time, I could probably have implemented more features, or made a more stable piece of code.
