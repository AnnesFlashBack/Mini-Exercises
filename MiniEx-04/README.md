## Initial Thought Process

The first step in deciding what I wanted to do for this assignment was to zone in on my angle of attack, so to speak. Luckily, it wasn’t very hard to figure out what I wanted to explore further with this exercise. 

As social media has become more and more prevalent in modern, digital culture, people are beginning to accept it as a natural part of their day-to-day lives. Sure, many people can probably go a day or two without their Instagram account, but what if someone took away your Internet? Or your smartphone? The ease with which we (myself very much included) use these tools and the benefits we gain from it on a daily basis, far outweigh the potential risks which lies in sharing your personal information in such a vast, open forum as social media has become. 

I thought of how willing and how required the feedback we get from social media is. We funnel more and more information and data into them, just so we can get some sort response or acknowledgement that “yes, you are doing alright.” That is what I wanted to explore with this assignment

## Small Fish, Big Pond

Initially, I wanted to utilize my webcam a huge amount, but unfortunately my camera on my laptop didn’t work. I had worked with microphone inputs in an earlier assignment and I didn’t much want to focus on that again, so I landed on the input of controlling with the mouse. 

In the program, you control a single fish who has gotten away from its stream. In the dark water there are no shapes or contours that it can recognize. There are no one who can help it, support it, or give it the attention it requires. When you first see the Facebook logo, I wanted your first thought to be that you should go to it. I tried to accomplish this by removing all other distractions from the canvas so there was just the logo. Once you touch the logo, a stream of like-icons come pouring out, briefly filling the screen with shapes. This was meant to represent the school the fish had gotten lost from and was now replacing. This stream grows bigger and bigger the longer the fish stays near the logo - or the more information and the more time one spends on social media. 

While this is happening, word bubbles are appearing around on the canvas. These are thoughts of self-doubt and a need for affection and attention brought on by the loneliness felt in the fish, which is partially but not fully covered up by the like icons swarming over the words. 

## Trawling Trouble
Normally, I like to make the canvas the same size as the window, but for the sake of my computer and yours I decided to lock the canvas down to a more manageable size. There are a lot of sprites flying around and they really eat up your memory if I hadn’t made the canvas smaller. The program might still run a bit poorly at times, but I have done my best to make it as smooth as possible. 

I also knew that I was going into uncharted territory. I utilized a lot of the p5.play library, which is extremely handy for animating and creating game-like mehcanics. However, it was a lot of information to chew through in a few days, and I'm sure my understanding of the p5.play functionalities is flawed, to put it mildly. 

But looking past that, I really hope you enjoy the program. [You can experience *Stream* for yourself here.](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnesFlashBack/Mini-Exercises/f80a25a0/MiniEx-04/MiniEx-04/index.html)

### Secret Ending
While the program runs, a little message will occasionally pop in the top of the canvas, telling the user through various phrases to leave. This is a reference to those who can become so addicted to social media they forget there is an actual world around them. For the fish, it is a reminder that the likes flying around are poor substitutes for its school and stream. Even though the likes cover op the dark canvas of nothing behind the fish. 

If the user was to start looking around, they would eventually find an exit. If you had trouble finding it, it is in the bottom right of the canvas. Upon leaving, a new program will load, running a slow animation of a school of fish swimming behind the lettering of a short poem. This was a bit of extra code I wanted to try, mostly because I wanted to explore the ways you might combine multiple .js files. It doesn't follow the requirements of the assignments since there is no visible data input or capture, but I thought it was acceptable given that this was just an extra, little thing that I really wanted to try.  

If you can't find it or if there is some other problem getting it to work, there is a link to the final stage [here.](https://cdn.rawgit.com/AnnesFlashBack/Mini-Exercises/9978aed2/MiniEx-04%20(Extra)/MiniEx-04-Extra/index.html)
