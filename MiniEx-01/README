For this project, I knew I wanted to explore the possibilities of the program on a very basic level. 
I wanted to learn how p5 worked and how to access the more simple functions of the language. 

I started with making a circle, changing its color, moving it around, and creating an interaction between the user and the object. 

In the end, I decided to settle on a psychedelic, old-school "PC-Lock-Screen"-feel, with the pathing of the circle being static, but
where the size would change depending on the volume of the audio input, picked up from the microphone.
