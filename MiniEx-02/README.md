With the concept of “fun” being the theme of this assignment, I was, ironically, a bit stumped for ideas. Mostly because another requirement for the assignment was that it should be an image made up of basic shapes. This was very hard for me. I had several ideas, all involving sounds or animation and none with only basic shapes. So I had to reconsider my idea of fun. 

I started thinking about the effects of fun. What happens when you are doing something you thoroughly enjoy? When you laugh and are having a blast? We all know that days are never as short as when spent in a theme park. 

When we have fun, time speeds up. Hours can pass in an instant, days can go by in what feels like mere moments. There have been many a night where I have stayed up “just one more hour, it’s not that late” only to see the sunrise outside my window. I wanted to mirror that feeling in this assignment. In a very basic sense, yes, but I wanted to try. 

I originally wanted the image to change with a simple mouseclick, but I couldn’t make it work. In addition, I had a pretty nasty flu which didn’t exactly help me focus. Though, I will say, the many nights I spend awake over the past week probably offered some inspiration in a weird sense. I definitely felt some frustrations with project, mostly because I couldn’t get to try some of the ideas I’ve been working on, but I know there will be amble opportunity to try them out at a later time.
